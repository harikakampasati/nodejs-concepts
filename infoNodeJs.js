/**
 * Node js is javascript runtime environment built on Google's open source v8 engine
 * it uses googles v8 engine.
 * any browser natively understand the html css js no matter if it is venilla js or js framework react js etc
 * browser provides all the tools  and libraries to execute and run javascript code
 * browser also provide some of the functions like console.log(), fetch api, querySelector(), getElementById() etc.. we use them while execute js code
 * before 2009 javascript has only capable of running inside the browser. there is no way to run javascript program outside of the browser environment
 * javascript engine is a tool required by the browser, every browser there is a javascript engine, which is responsible of execute javascript code.
 * every browser there has their own javascript engine for example :- firefox: spider monkey, microsoft edge: chakra, 
 * in the same way the javascript engine of the google chrome is v8 engine. 
 * the v8 engine is the responsible executing javascript code in the chrome browser
 * before 2009 it was not possible to do execute javascript program outside of the browser 
 * but in 2009 a programmer named as Ryan Dahl creator of node.js, came out with a brillient idea that google he took v8 engine embedded in C++ program and he called it as node js.
 * same as simillar to a browser, node js a run time environment to execute a javascript code. and it contain the javascript engine (V8 engine) which can execute a javascript code.
 * that why we say that nodejs is the javascript runtime environment which is bult google v8 javascript engine
 * node js has some additional apis that gives as capability to run javascript outside of the browser. (examples http(), fs, readline, console.log)
 * now we can do so many thing javascript which was completely impossible before. ( for example accessing file system etc..)
 * all these factors together gives us the perfect condition for using node js a service side language means we can use javascript as service side of the web development in order build fast highly scalable network application for the backend of the websites
